QUESTION 2.1.1 - causing conflicts:
Why does it take many iterations before errors are seen?
Why does a significantly smaller number of iterations so seldom fail?

I got conflicts when I used 2 threads and 1000 iterations. It takes a more iterations to cause errors because it increases the chance that 2 threads are accessing the variable at the same time. With smaller iterations, there are fewer chances for the threads to overlap because after accessing the counter they exit. 

QUESTION 2.1.2 - cost of yielding:
Why are the --yield runs so much slower?
Where is the additional time going?
Is it possible to get valid per-operation timings if we are using the --yield option?
If so, explain how. If not, explain why not.
